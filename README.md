Ecommerce - Technion course

In this exercise we built a recommendation system for the Spotify app. <br>
The attached data contains a record of playbacks among about 2,000 users and close to 20,000 artists.<br>
For the purpose of building the recommendation system, we used information from the social network describing relationships between the users.<br>
Based on this data, we will predict the number of times a certain user will listen to a certain artist.<br>
